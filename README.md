# hello-world

Totally new to this! 
Warning: I am a very creative, non-creative person. 
I have many great ideas, and no clue how to execute them.
Yes, I'm one of those "You're a software developer? I have a great app idea " people that everyone hates.
I am also a software developer-ish, but not really.
I like data, a lot. And so I go where ever data takes me.
I think this really will be...
The start of something great!
